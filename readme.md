Installation
------------

The best way to install Web Project is using Composer. If you don't have Composer yet,
download it following [the instructions](https://doc.nette.org/composer). Then use command:

	composer create-project nette/sandbox path/to/install
	cd path/to/install


Make directories `temp/` and `log/` writable.


Web Server Setup
----------------

The simplest way to get started is to start the built-in PHP server in the root directory of your project:

	php -S localhost:8000 -t www

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the welcome page.

For Apache or Nginx, setup a virtual host to point to the `www/` directory of the project and you
should be ready to go.

It is CRITICAL that whole `app/`, `config`, `log/` and `temp/` directories are not accessible directly
via a web browser. See [security warning](https://nette.org/security-warning).


Requirements
------------

- Sandbox for Nette 3.1 requires PHP 7.4

To check whether server configuration meets the minimum requirements for
Nette Framework browse to the directory `/checker` in your project root (i.e. `http://localhost:8000/checker`).


Adminer
-------

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is full-featured database management tool written in PHP and it is part of this Sandbox.
To use it, browse to the subdirectory `/adminer` in your project root (i.e. `http://localhost:8000/adminer`).


PHPStan
-------

[PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) is static analysis tool to discover bugs in your code without running it.
